We are just down from the showers so cleanup isn’t an issue, or you can just lick each other clean.\r\n\r\nFire Massage – Don’t see the burn, come feel it!  Experience the roar of the fire and the thrill of flames dancing on your skin … feeling the heat; feeling your flesh burn … all without leaving a mark on you.   Our experts will guide you on a journey sure to leave you drooling for more. This is a truly titillating experience for the less hairy folks.  Please do not wear colognes, body lotions, bug spray, or other flammable substances.  We only have one fire extinguisher and she will probably be drunk!\r\n\r\nFlogging/Canes – Enjoy the sensations of several types of floggers and canes. We will demonstrate how material, construction, and technique can vary the sensations. This may just inspire you into embrace a side of yourself that you have not discovered.\r\n\r\nSensual play – Imagine you are blindfolded and can’t see.  All you can do is feel …. feel the sensation of fur as it glides delicately along your skin.  Experience a silk scarf exciting your senses. Enjoy the scent and sensation of leather as it caresses you.  A true feast for the senses.  Just say Ahhhhhh.  Safeword not needed.\r\n\r\nMassage – Come by and feel the big strong hands removing the stress from your body.  Our self appointed un- LMT, can take you into a whole new dimension of enjoyment.\r\n\r\nKnife Play –Knives aren’t just for the kitchen.  Come and enjoy the unique sensation as the cool steel moves over your skin.  Scary?  Yes!  But seductive too. If you’ve even wondered what it would be like making love with Edward Scissorhands, this might be the kink for you.   Even though you may feel you have been sliced open, our experts can guide you on this journey with no cutting or blood involved.  There may be a scratch or two (if you are into that), but chicks/dicks dig scars!\r\n\r\nSpanking – Come by and spank or get spanked!  This really needs no explanation.\r\n\r\nFree Hugs – Stop by for a free hug from Shameless or give us one.  Hugs make the world a better place.",
